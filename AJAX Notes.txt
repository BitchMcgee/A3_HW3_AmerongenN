DEV Roadmap


The end goal to determine success with this project is to get the live web page on my workspace to be identical to the screenshot provided. To find what parts I need to interact with I am reviewing the class files and comparing the use of AJAX to the content it presents so I can know what content on the current file is the right section to have the function focus on.


In the <div> parent tag there is a class called profPanel so I am using that one to call the content and fill in the child tags. It is the div tag that is connected to the rest of the tags so if I can target it correctly and call upon the classData I can call to the required sections coursename, coursecode being in profPanelText, and profname, classtime and profimg on the bottom half.


Unfortunately I was unable to ultimately get the text to appear in the box but I intend to continue using this content to further develop my FIP site and learn what I was unable to do correctly, as I plan to use AJAX heavily to display dynamic content of each section of my portfolio site.
